This repository is a collection of numerical calculus methods implemented and tested in Python 3, designed to solve a variety of mathematical problems through numerical approximations. As of now, it includes the bisection method, Lagrange interpolation, Gauss elimination, and more methods are planned to be added in the future.


# Implemented Methods
1. Bisection Method: numerical_calculus.bisection
- Find the root of a function within a specified interval.
2. Lagrange Interpolation: numerical_calculus.lagrange
- Perform Lagrange interpolation to approximate a function from a set of data points.
3. Gauss Elimination: numerical_calculus.gauss_elimination
- Solve systems of linear equations using the Gauss elimination method.

These are just a sample of methods developed during numerical calculus class. More methods are planned to be added in the future.
